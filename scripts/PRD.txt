# Overview
Modern Todo Web Application is a sleek, responsive single-page application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. It solves the common problem of task management by providing an intuitive, accessible interface that works across all devices. The application targets professionals and students who need a clean, distraction-free environment to organize their daily tasks.

# Core Features

1. Task Management
   - Add, edit, and delete tasks with real-time updates
   - Mark tasks as complete/incomplete with visual feedback
   - Rich text support for task descriptions
   - Why: Essential CRUD operations for basic task management
   - How: React components with optimistic UI updates

2. Task Organization
   - Filter tasks by status (All/Active/Completed)
   - Sort tasks by creation date or priority
   - Drag-and-drop reordering
   - Why: Helps users quickly find and organize their tasks
   - How: React state management with filter/sort algorithms

3. Data Persistence
   - Automatic saving to localStorage
   - Offline support
   - Data sync across browser tabs
   - Why: Ensures user data is never lost
   - How: Browser storage APIs with sync events

4. UI/UX Features
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Dark/light theme support
   - Smooth animations and transitions
   - Why: Creates a polished, professional feel
   - How: Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion

# User Experience

User Personas:
1. Professional Worker
   - Needs: Quick task entry, efficient organization
   - Goals: Stay organized during workday
   - Pain Points: Complex interfaces, slow performance

2. Student
   - Needs: Simple task tracking, clear deadlines
   - Goals: Manage assignments and deadlines
   - Pain Points: Overwhelming features, difficult navigation

Key User Flows:
1. Task Creation
   - Click add button/press enter
   - Type task description
   - Optional: Add details/deadline
   - Save automatically

2. Task Management
   - View all tasks in main list
   - Click checkbox to complete
   - Swipe/click to edit/delete
   - Filter view as needed

UI/UX Considerations:
- Minimalist design focusing on content
- Touch-friendly interface
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Immediate feedback for all actions

# Technical Architecture

System Components:
1. Frontend (Next.js + React)
   - Components for task CRUD operations
   - State management using React hooks
   - Client-side routing
   - TypeScript for type safety

2. Styling System
   - Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
   - CSS Modules for component-specific styles
   - CSS Variables for theming

3. Data Layer
   - localStorage for persistence
   - Context API for state management
   - TypeScript interfaces for data models

Data Models:
```typescript
interface Todo {
  id: string;
  text: string;
  completed: boolean;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  priority?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
}

interface TodoState {
  todos: Todo[];
  filter: 'all' | 'active' | 'completed';
  theme: 'light' | 'dark';
}
```

# Risks and Mitigations

Technical Challenges:
1. Performance with Large Lists
   - Risk: Slow rendering with many tasks
   - Mitigation: Virtual scrolling, pagination

2. State Management Complexity
   - Risk: Difficult state updates and syncing
   - Mitigation: Clear state architecture, TypeScript

3. Browser Compatibility
   - Risk: Inconsistent behavior across browsers
   - Mitigation: Progressive enhancement, feature detection

MVP Considerations:
1. Feature Scope
   - Risk: Feature creep
   - Mitigation: Strict MVP definition, iterative approach

2. Technical Debt
   - Risk: Rushed implementation
   - Mitigation: Clear code structure, documentation

Resource Constraints:
1. Development Time
   - Risk: Underestimating implementation time
   - Mitigation: Modular development, clear priorities
